    <main style="background: whitesmoke;"><h1>Energy</h1>
    <section><p>We play a multifaceted role in the financial ecosystem, offering a range of services that fall into three broad categories: Assurance, Non-Assurance, and Other Related Services.
These services are offered to energy sector, 'including but not limited to'  oil & gas, renewables, utilities, and energy efficiency services. Generally these include:<br>
- Financial Audits: Ensuring accurate financial reporting for energy companies, which often deal with large capital expenditures and complex asset valuations.
- Environmental Compliance Audits: Verifying adherence to environmental regulations and sustainability standards.
- Energy Efficiency Audits: Evaluating energy usage and identifying areas for cost savings and carbon footprint reduction (as described in ISO 50002).
- Risk Management: Assessing operational and financial risks, especially in volatile markets like oil and gas.</p>

‚úÖ Assurance Services
These are services where the auditor provides an independent opinion to enhance the reliability of information:
- Statutory Financial Audits
- Internal Audits
- Compliance Audits
- Sustainability Reporting Assurance
- Due Diligence for M&A in the energy sector
These services are governed by strict independence and ethical standards to ensure objectivity.

üö´ Non-Assurance Services
These are services that do not involve expressing an audit opinion. However, they can pose independence risks if provided to audit clients. Examples include:
- Tax Services (e.g., tax return preparation)
- Accounting and Bookkeeping
- IT System Implementation
- Valuation Services
- Legal Services
- Recruitment or HR Services
Regulations often prohibit auditors from providing certain non-assurance services to Public Interest Entities (PIEs) due to the risk of self-review threats. For instance, the ICAEW Code of Ethics outlines strict rules on when and how these services can be provided.

üõ°Ô∏è Other Related Services
Auditors may also offer:
- Advisory Services (e.g., energy strategy, carbon trading)
- Forensic Audits (e.g., fraud investigations)
- Cybersecurity Audits (especially relevant for smart grids and energy tech)
- Sustainability Consulting (e.g., ESG reporting frameworks)

If you‚Äôre exploring this from a professional or academic angle, I can help you dive deeper into regulations, case studies, or even build a framework for auditor engagement in the energy sector. Just say the word.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: We maintain independence when offering non-assurance services to audit clients. Regulatory frameworks  restrict certain services to avoid conflicts of interest.</dd>
