<dt id="1">âœ… Assurance Services</dt>
<dd>These are services where the auditor provides an independent opinion to enhance confidence in financial or non-financial information:
<ul><li>- Statutory audits of financial statements</li>
<li>- Review engagements (less rigorous than audits but still provide limited assurance)</li>
<li>- Compliance audits (e.g., Basel III, anti-money laundering)</li>
<li>- Risk assurance and controls testing</li>
<li>- Sustainability or ESG assurance, increasingly relevant in modern banking</li></ul>
Assurance services are tightly regulated to preserve auditor independence.</dd>

<dt id="2">ðŸš« Non-Assurance Services</dt>
<dd>These are services that do not involve expressing an opinion on financial statements or other subject matter. Examples include:
<ul><li>- Tax advisory and planning</li>
<li>- Accounting and bookkeeping (though limited for audit clients due to independence concerns)</li>
<li>- IT system implementation</li>
<li>- Training and consulting</li>
<li>- Valuation services</li></ul>
Auditors must be cautious when offering these to audit clients, as they can create conflicts of interest or independence threats.</dd>

<dt id="3">ðŸ”„ Other Related Services</dt>
<dd>Some additional services that auditors may provide include:
<ul><li>- Forensic audits (investigating fraud or misconduct)</li>
<li>- Due diligence for mergers and acquisitions</li>
<li>- Regulatory reporting support</li>
<li>- Cybersecurity assessments</li>
<li>- Internal control consulting</li></ul>
These services are often tailored to the specific needs of financial institutions and must comply with ethical and legal boundaries.</dd>
