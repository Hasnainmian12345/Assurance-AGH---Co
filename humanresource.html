    <main style="background-color: whitesmoke;"><h1>Human Resource</h1>
    <section>We provide human resource (HR) services in both assurance and non-assurance capacities, but there are strict ethical and regulatory boundariesâ€”especially when the auditor is also the statutory auditor of the client. Here's a breakdown:


<dt>âœ… Assurance Services Related to HR</dt>
<dd>These are services where the auditor provides an independent opinion or conclusion to enhance confidence in HR-related information:
    <ul>
<li>- Payroll audits: Verifying accuracy and compliance of payroll systems.</li>
<li>- Compliance audits: Ensuring HR policies align with labor laws and regulations.</li>
<li>- Employee benefit plan audits: Reviewing pension or retirement plans for regulatory compliance.</li>
<li>- HR process assurance: Evaluating internal controls over recruitment, onboarding, and termination processes.</li></ul>
These services are typically part of broader internal or operational audits and must maintain auditor independence.</dd>

<dt>ðŸš« Non-Assurance HR Services</dt>
<dd>These are advisory or support services that do not involve expressing an audit opinion. They can pose independence risks if provided to audit clients and so When non-assurance HR services are allowed, we
<ul><li>- Avoid assuming management responsibilities.</li>
<li>- Disclose services to those charged with governance.</li>
<li>- Apply safeguards like separate teams or peer reviews.</li></ul>
<dt>Permissible (with safeguards):</dt>
<ul><li>- Advisory on HR strategy: Offering insights on workforce planning or organizational structure.</li>
<li>- Benchmarking compensation: Comparing salary structures with industry standards.</li>
<li>- Training programs: Conducting workshops on ethics, compliance, or HR best practices.</li></ul>
<dt>Prohibited (for audit clients, especially Public Interest Entities):</dt>
<dd><ul>- Recruitment or hiring decisions: Selecting or recommending candidates for key roles.
<li>- Setting compensation: Designing or approving pay packages for senior management.</li>
<li>- Assuming management responsibilities: Making decisions or acting on behalf of the clientâ€™s HR department.</li></ul>
These restrictions are designed to prevent self-review threats and maintain auditor independence.</dd>
